## Development

Make sure you have Node.js installed and the following packages:

```bash
npm install -g vuepress
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-innovet-vuepress-course
```

### Running a Development Server

To start a local development server execute the following command inside the root folder of this project:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This will start a local server and automatically convert the markdown files to html files.

Open a browser to the web address shown by the `npm run` command. Most typically this is [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Generating Pages

A page is like a new chapter in your course. You can generate a new page by using the `innovet-vuepress-course` generator:

```bash
yo innovet-vuepress-course:page
```
